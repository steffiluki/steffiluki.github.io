<h3>What do we do?</h3>
<p>We are a Newcastle-based delivery service for vegetarian lunches made from locally sourced ingredients.</p>

<p>You can order your lunch daily until 4pm for the next day or even for the whole week. We then cook it up freshly and bring it to you - on a bike between 10am and 12pm to your office or your home. You can then simply warm your lunch up or eat it cold.</p>

<p>We cook fresh daily, with 100% organic, seasonal ingredients mostly from local farmers. We keep an eye on variety in our dishes that are made with love. We do spice our dishes, but only a little so not to destroy the great taste of the ingredients itself.</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>

<p><b>Anna</b> is a foodie and studied business in Berlin, London and New York. There, she saw literally every restaurant possible and loved it. This made her realise that she wants to keep working with food and after meeting Julia in London they decided to found <i>Lunch on a bike</i> together.</p><br/>
